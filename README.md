# Trajectory_prediction

At current stage, I just implemented the LSTM to do trajectory prediction

requirements:
tensorflow 2.*
python 3.8

run `main.py`
- `test()` in `main.py` is to test in the datasets
- `test_for_real()` in `main.py` is to test for real. Assume no testing dataset. Just do prediction based on the observed trajectories.
